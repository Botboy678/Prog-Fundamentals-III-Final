# Chapter 1 Lab Report: Binary Search Algorithms
## Student Information
- Name: Emmanuel Onotota
- Date: 4/3
## Implementation Overview
The binary search implementation wasn't difficult as all one 
had to do was adjust the start and end pointer depeding on where 
the target was located in comparison to the middle of the array
## Test Results
I ran some test cases for the book titles and although varying titles 
give take different times each book when ran twice or more would average it's same time with only slight differences in the floating points - 
Like - 4.3455 or 4.63... or 4.034 and so on ( all averaging around 4);
## Challenges and Solutions
None thus far
## Learning Outcomes
I've learnt the binary search 
How to create my own header files and how to include them in my main files 
How to measure operations in using the chrono lib
Parsing text as Json data using the nlohmann lib
