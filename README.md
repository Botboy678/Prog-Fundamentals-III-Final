# Book Library Application: A Practical Journey Through Algorithms and Data Structures

This project is an opportunity for me to build a **Book Library Application** while learning Git and GitHub. Each lab builds on the previous one, reinforcing concepts like algorithms (e.g., binary search, quicksort, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm) and data structures (e.g., hash tables, trees). By the end, I'll not only have a completed application but also a deeper understanding of how to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

I'll also use this as a chance to:
- Practice version control with Git.
- Manage my project repository on GitHub.
- Improve my coding and problem-solving skills.

The final submission will combine everything I've learned across all 12 labs into one cohesive application.
